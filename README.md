# SMS-Spam-Classification-
Say goodbye to annoying spam texts with our smart system that tells you if a message is spam or not â€“ it's like having a personal text superhero!


## Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based SMS spam classifier using a Naive Bayes model and TF-IDF vectorization. The system is designed to efficiently classify incoming SMS messages as spam or not spam. The integration of a Streamlit web application enhances user interaction and accessibility.

## Project Files

- **SMS Spam Classification.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the source code for the project.
- **app.py**: Python script for the Streamlit web application.
- **model.pkl**: Pickled file containing the trained Naive Bayes classifier.
- **spam.csv**: Dataset file in Excel format containing labeled SMS messages.
- **vectorizer.pkl**: Pickled file containing the TF-IDF vectorizer.

## Usage

1. Open and run `SMS Spam Classification.ipynb` to explore the code and model training.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`
